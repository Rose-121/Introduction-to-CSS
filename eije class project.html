      Welcome to the ASTROHUB, where the universe unfolds one star at a time!

    <h3>Space â€“ The Final Frontier</h3>
    <p>
      Space, also known as outer space, is the vast, seemingly infinite expanse
      that exists beyond Earth's atmosphere. It is a vacuum, meaning it is
      mostly empty of matter, with no air, sound, or atmosphere. Space is where
      celestial bodies like stars, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and
      galaxies exist.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Aspects about Space:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Universe:</strong> Space is home to the entire universe,
        which includes billions of galaxies, each containing billions of stars,
        planets, and other celestial objects. Our own galaxy is the Milky Way.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Zero Gravity:</strong> In space, there is no gravity like we
        experience on Earth. This is why astronauts float in spacecraft or space
        stations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Planets and Stars:</strong> Planets like Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
        and others orbit stars. Our solar system is centered around the Sun, a
        star that provides light and heat to our planet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Distance and Time:</strong> Space is incredibly vast. Distances
        between objects like stars and galaxies are measured in light-years,
        which is the distance light travels in one year (about 9.46 trillion
        kilometers). For example, the closest star to Earth (other than the Sun)
        is Proxima Centauri, which is about 4.24 light-years away.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Expanding Universe:</strong> The universe is constantly
        expanding, with galaxies moving away from each other. This discovery was
        first made by astronomer Edwin Hubble.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Space Exploration:</strong> Humans have been exploring space for
        decades. We send spacecraft, satellites, and telescopes to study distant
        planets, moons, and galaxies. Missions like landing on the Moon, sending
        rovers to Mars, and launching space telescopes like Hubble have greatly
        increased our understanding of space.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Space Technology:</strong> Space exploration requires advanced
        technology, like rockets, space probes, and space stations such as the
        International Space Station (ISS), where astronauts live and work in
        space for extended periods.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cosmic Events:</strong> Space is filled with fascinating events
        such as supernovae (exploding stars), black holes, and pulsars (rotating
        neutron stars emitting beams of radiation).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="rose">Space Mysteries to Unravel</h3>
    <p>
      Space is still largely unexplored, and scientists continue to search for
      answers about its mysteries, such as the possibility of life on other
      planets or what dark matter and dark energy really are.
    </p>

    <h3 class="plain">Interesting Facts About Space:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Space is completely silent:</strong> Because space is a vacuum,
        there is no medium (like air) to carry sound waves. So, even if there
        was a big explosion or something making noise in space, you wouldnâ€™t
        hear it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus:</strong> Venus
        takes 243 Earth days to complete one rotation on its axis (a single
        day), but only 225 Earth days to complete an orbit around the Sun (a
        year). This means its day is longer than its year!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Neutron stars are incredibly dense:</strong> A neutron star is
        the remnants of a star that has exploded in a supernova. The core that
        remains is so dense that just a teaspoon of its material would weigh
        about 6 billion tons on Earth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>There may be a "multiverse":</strong> Some scientists believe
        that our universe could be just one of many in a "multiverse." Each
        universe in the multiverse could have different laws of physics and
        dimensions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Space is expanding:</strong> The universe isnâ€™t static; itâ€™s
        constantly expanding. This discovery came from observing distant
        galaxies moving away from us, suggesting that the universe has been
        expanding since the Big Bang and continues to do so.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jupiter's Great Red Spot is shrinking:</strong> The Great Red
        Spot on Jupiter is a massive storm that has been raging for at least 350
        years, but itâ€™s slowly shrinking. Scientists are unsure why, but it may
        eventually disappear.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>There are rogue planets:</strong> Some planets don't orbit stars
        and are instead drifting through space on their own, often referred to
        as "rogue planets." Itâ€™s thought that there could be more rogue planets
        in our galaxy than there are stars.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A year on Mercury is just 88 Earth days:</strong> Mercury is the
        closest planet to the Sun, and it has an orbit that is much shorter than
        Earthâ€™s, making a year on Mercury only 88 days. But a day on Mercury
        lasts 176 Earth days!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Saturn's moon Titan has lakes of methane:</strong> Titan, one of
        Saturn's moons, is the only place besides Earth where scientists have
        observed stable bodies of liquid on the surface. But instead of water,
        Titan has lakes of methane, which is a gas on Earth!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Astronautsâ€™ height changes in space:</strong> When astronauts go
        to space, their spines elongate because there's no gravity to compress
        them. As a result, they can grow up to 2 inches taller while in space,
        but they return to their normal height after they return to Earth.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="space">The Wonders of Space Await!</h4>
